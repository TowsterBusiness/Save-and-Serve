## What does Save & Serve do?
Our app Save & Serve limits food waste by providing users with recipes that utilize their soon-to-expire ingredients. Save & Serve takes photos of your fridge, identifies the ingredients you have, analyzes which ingredients have the shortest lifespan, and searches through thousands of recipes for meals you can create with them.

## What inspired us to create this app?
After doing the app challenge last year as individuals, Tyler and I teamed up and started planning what we wanted to create at my house. When we went to make a meal, we realized that we had no clue how to combine the unique ingredients we saw in our fridge and pantry, let alone the ones that were about to expire (Food waste!). We quickly realized this was not something that happened for the first time. 

To determine whether this was an issue in our community, we conducted door-to-door interviews with Carlsbad Families and found that a majority of families encounter this issue on a biweekly basis. We had identified the problem we needed to solve.

## What technical difficulties did you face programming your app?
Ingredient detection is not an easy task, especially when the ingredients you are trying to find are hidden in the back of the fridge. To address this challenge, we tasked the object identification models used to find ingredients with photos of the fridge from different angles, so that we leave no ingredient unaccounted for.

## What improvements would you make if you were to create a 2.0 version of your app?
In our v2 of Save & Serve (more like v15 since it went through many iterations ðŸ˜‚), we would raise more money to pay for web services that can speed up the time it takes to process and distribute image data. Next, we would further improve the performance of our app by utilizing AutoML, a machine learning service used by Google that trains large models on specific datasets (in our case, common fridge items). 

Most importantly, we would advertise this app to people outside of our community.  Presenting it at the Hour of Code event would be a phenomenal opportunity for us to do exactly that.

## What did you learn or take away from participating in the Congressional App Challenge?
This year, as a team, we had to learn how to collaborate and divvy up tasks of the project. Teamwork was essential in many different ways, whether it be recording our interviews with Carlsbad Families, programming and testing the app on different devices, or meeting up to record parts of the video submission. This was a team effort, and we would do it all over again! Unfortunately, this is our last chance to work together because Tyler is a senior. Nevertheless, we hope to strengthen our friendship this high school year and maybe attend the House of Code event together!
